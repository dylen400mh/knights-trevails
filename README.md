# Knight Moves

## Overview

This project implements a function that finds the shortest path for a knight on a chessboard to move from one square to another, while outputting all the squares the knight will stop on along the way.
Given a starting square `[x1, y1]` and an ending square `[x2, y2]`, the `knightMoves` function calculates the shortest path that the knight can take to move from the starting square to the ending square.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. From the project directory, simply run the following command:
`node index.js`
## Notes
- This project uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path.
- The implementation ensures that all knight moves stay within the bounds of the chessboard.
